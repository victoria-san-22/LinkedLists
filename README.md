# LinkedLists

This is a project I completed in my second programming class at UA, CSC 120. You can see the overall project description here:


Purpose: This program provides methods for analyzing
or altering any given linked list. It has methods for
determining if a given list is sorted, summing a list's
int values, partitioning a list, returning every 
fourth node from a given point, and returning a list of
ordered pairs from two lists.
